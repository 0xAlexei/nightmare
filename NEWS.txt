Nightmare 0.0.4 - ?????????
---------------------------

 * Added option in the web interface to download project results (only one crash per different bug + corresponding diff file if any).
 * Ported Nightmare to SQLite database. You can use either MySQL or SQLite now.
 * Added mutator ole_file_mutator.py and ole_file_mutator_multiple.py to fuzz OLE2 documents (surprise) using OleFileIO_PL.

Nightmare 0.0.3 - July 2014
---------------------------

 * Added generic_client_server.py fuzzer.
 * Added support for minimizing crash files.
 * Added blind_coverage_fuzzer.py fuzzer.
 * Added mutator zzuf_mutator.py and zzuf_mutator_multiple.py.
 * Added support to find the original template file for a crash file.
 * Added a half intelligent MachO format aware mutator.
 * The "Charlie Miller" mutators have been enhanced and now they are 
   fast. Before, they were painfully slow.
